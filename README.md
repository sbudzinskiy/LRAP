# LRAP
This is a collection of Fortran subroutines for the constrained low-rank approximation of matrices and tensors:
- [low-rank nonnegative matrix and tensor approximation](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40314-023-02211-2) (not to be confused with NMF)
- low-rank nonnegative matrix completion
- low-rank matrix and tensor approximation in the maximum norm

The algorithms are based on the method of [(quasioptimal) alternating projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16097).

## How to build
Follow the guidelines of the [MARIA-Fortran](https://github.com/sbudzinskiy/MARIA-Fortran) project, which is used for working with low-rank matrices and tensors.
